## AirportAutomationAPI
In this project, I have undertaken the challenge of developing a full-fledged Web API. It involves several key components and practices that I believe are fundamental in building a successful API. Here's a brief overview of what you can expect to find in this project:

### Creating the API and Returning Resources:
- Establishing the foundation of the Web API and defining endpoints.
- Implementing the logic to retrieve and return resources in response to client requests.

### Manipulating Resources and Validating Input:
- Demonstrating how to manipulate data resources and ensure data integrity.
- Implementing input validation techniques to enhance the reliability of the API.

### Working with Services and Dependency Injection:
- Employing services and dependency injection to promote modularity and maintainability in the codebase.

### Getting Acquainted with Entity Framework Core:
- Introducing Entity Framework Core, a powerful ORM tool for data access.
- Learning how to configure and interact with the database using Entity Framework Core.

### Using Entity Framework Core in Controllers:
- Integrating Entity Framework Core into API controllers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data resources.

### Searching, Filtering, and Paging Resources:
- Implementing advanced features like searching, filtering, and paging to enhance the API's usability and performance.

### Securing API and CORS Implementation:
- Ensuring API security involves robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- CORS is carefully configured to permit legitimate cross-origin requests while maintaining security against unauthorized access.

### Versioning and Documenting API with Swagger:
- Managing API versions to maintain backward compatibility.
- Documenting the API endpoints for easy consumption by developers.

### Logging and Exception Handling for Error Management:
- Implementing comprehensive logging and exception handling mechanisms to track system activities, record errors, and manage unforeseen scenarios within the application.
- This integrated approach ensures better visibility into the application's behavior, simplifies troubleshooting efforts and contributes to the overall maintainability and reliability of the API.

### API Rate Limiting:
- Implementing a rate limiter is crucial for Protecting API Resources by preventing abuse, fortifying the system against DDoS Attacks, and Enhancing API Performance.

### Unit Testing with xUnit: 
- Writing comprehensive unit tests using the xUnit framework to validate individual components of the application, ensuring that each unit functions correctly in isolation. 
- These tests help maintain code integrity, improve software reliability, and facilitate easier debugging and refactoring.

### Monitoring Application Health with HealthChecks:
- Monitoring the health of critical components, such as databases and external dependencies, to proactively identify and address potential issues.
- Configuring health check endpoints to offer insights into the overall well-being of the application, and integrating these checks into the Swagger documentation for visibility and ease of access.

### Consuming APIs with HttpClientFactory:
- Implementing efficient API calls using HttpClientFactory for improved performance and resource management, ensuring seamless integration with external APIs while maintaining optimal usage of resources.

### Integrating Web Services and APIs:
- Consuming external web services and APIs to fetch real-time data or integrate third-party functionalities, allowing seamless data exchange and integration with backend services.

### Managing Data Presentation and User Input:
- Handling dynamic data presentation on web pages using templates and binding techniques while implementing user input forms and validating submitted data for accuracy.

### Client-Side Scripting and AJAX Requests:
- Utilizing JavaScript and AJAX requests to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, enabling asynchronous data fetching and updating without full page reloads.

### Ensuring Web Application Security:
- Implementing security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities, enforcing HTTPS, securing data transmission, and safeguarding against threats like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
